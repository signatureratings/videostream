# videostream
instead of requesting the total video file you can send chunks of data to save the user's date 

# Pros
we can save the user data and give better experience

# Cons
user can make many requests if he wants to watch the video again so this makes to consume more data than the file

use this wisely by sending the avg chunk of data like 1MB or depending on the users network speed.
